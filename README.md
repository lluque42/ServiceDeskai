# ServiceDeskai

This is the first stage of a project idea to develop a mobile-first application for reporting problems and damaged items in offices using geolocation and image recognition AI. At the moment, we have only developed a basic front-end draft of what the app would look like, but there is no actual functionality yet.

## Introduction

What this Project should do:
* Developing a mobile-first application for reporting problems and damaged items.
* Using geolocation and machine learning to streamline reporting.
* Implementing user authentication with JWT for secure API access.
* Designing an app that meets WCAG AA accessibility standards.
* Managing multiple user roles: standard users, service desk, and admin.
* Creating reports with personal data, location, and media attachments.
* Sharing reports via email and viewing report history by status.
* Adding features like chat, admin controls, offline mode, and dark mode.
* Enhancing the app with image recognition and AI-driven intelligence using APIs like Google Cloud Vision.

## Current Status

### Front-End Draft

(Developed using React-Redux)

The current state of the project is a basic front-end draft that outlines the visual structure of the application. This draft includes:
* Basic layout and design elements.
* Placeholder components for future functionality.
* Initial styling to give an idea of the final look and feel.

### No Functionality Yet

Please note that this draft does not include any actual functionality. The following features are not yet implemented:
* User authentication
* Geolocation
* Image recognition
* API integration
* Data management
* Any other interactive features

## Future Development

The next stages of development will focus on implementing the core functionalities outlined in the project idea. This will include:
* Setting up a back-end server and database.
* Implementing user authentication and authorization.
* Integrating geolocation and image recognition APIs.
* Developing the reporting and data management features.
* Ensuring accessibility and usability standards are met.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and enhance the application.
